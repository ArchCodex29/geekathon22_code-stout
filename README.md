## The idea

### Problem(s) in question

* As a user, when I arrive at a city or a place, if I have questions, I don't know where to turn, whether it is to get information on my current location, or to find shops that sell souvenirs that I'm interested.

### Solution(s)

* Virtual assistant, in the form of chat or TTS bot to help locals or tourists get around the city. Make the city come alive and have a local (virtual) guide at all times.

#### Questions by topic

* Monuments/Culture Sites
  * What are the main attractions (of the city) ?
    * Follow up: Tell me more information about the castle ?
      * Extra: Can I read more about it ?
* General Information
  * What's the population (of the city/district) ?
    * Extra: More info(rmation) ? (Link)
* Souvenirs
  * Where can I buy some souvenirs ?
  * Are there any shops/stores, around that i can buy some souvenirs ? (Location-based)
* ...
