## Problem(s) in question

* As a user, when I arrive at a city or a place, if I have questions, I don't know where to turn, whether it is to get information on my current location, or to find shops that sell souvenirs that I'm interested.

## Solution(s)

* Virtual assistant, in the form of chat or TTS bot to help locals or tourists get around the city. Make the city come alive and have a local (virtual) guide at all times. It can answer a set of available questions about the city (and district)
