A project for a companion app about events @ Leiria

## The idea

Trip Recommendation and Planning (Companion) App

As a user, I want to plan a trip as fast as possible. I waste too much time booking hotels, plan and schedule the itenerary of the trip and commute. Sometimes I also don't know the events or places of interest, so I waste more time checking those for each city or destination of the trip. Aligning the vacation time for the trip.

Story: As a user, i want to plan a trip as fast as possible, so i can save as much time for the trip.

## Why ? 

## Components (ideally)
 - Webpage / Mobile App
 - BD with event data
